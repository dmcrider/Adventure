    A nearby town has been overrun with Orcs and he would like you, a strong-looking << RACE >> to go check on his family that lives there.

You agree and head to the market to pick up some supplies.
    On the way there, a seller whose poor reputation preceedes him, approaches you.
    If you give him << 60 >> gold, he'll give you a scroll that he claims will aid you later in your adventure
